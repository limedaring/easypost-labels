# EasyPost API label creation

Program to create labels using the EasyPost API. 

## Warning: Hard-Coded Values 

Currently has my book's (Hello Web App: http://hellowebapp.com) information
hard-coded but you can easily update it to match your needs. Some values have
been moved to settings but not all. I welcome any help!

## Usage example for Canada

```
$ python post.py --domestic=CA orders.csv
```
